Iâ€™m a **Data Scientist** and Pharmacist (PhD) whose professional journey has been shaped by diverse experiences aimed at enhancing business value and contributing to the scientific community by making Data Science more accessible to non-specialists.

Currently, I serve as a **Professor in the Data Science program** at the University of the City of Buenos Aires, where I train IT professionals in the fundamentals of **Artificial Intelligence**, with a particular focus on Symbolic AI (e.g., Expert Systems).

As a Project Manager at Talento CientÃ­fico, **I help SMEs find top-tier scientists** for their projects, with a specialization in the Data Science field. My goal is to match the right talent with each science-based business.

Before this role, I had the privilege of working at the **Francis Crick Institute in London**. There, I held a postdoctoral position in the Cancer Metabolism Lab, exploring the link between glucose metabolism, tumor growth, and liver physiology. Later, as a Project Manager in the Academic Training Team, I led initiatives to support postdoctoral career development.

My scientific journey began in Argentina, where I earned a **PhD** at the Institute of Immunological and Physiopathological Studies (IIFP). My research focused on the role of ion channels in regulating pH in tumor cells.

**Skills:** Python programming (Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit, PyKE), machine learning model development, AWS, Spark, Docker, R.
